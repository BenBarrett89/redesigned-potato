I wanted to play around with generating a PDF from a CSV file

I am going to follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VgghGKx_1c)
through and add some CSV parsing stuff to it

## Running ##

### Dependencies ###

Requires `npm` and `node` to be installed

Install module dependencies:

```terminal
npm install
```

### Running the script ###

```terminal
npm start
```

You will be prompted for the filename of the CSV file (`sample`) and then asked
for the title of the report (which will be used as the output filename too):

```terminal
prompt: filename:  sample
prompt: report:  test
File outputted: test.pdf
```
